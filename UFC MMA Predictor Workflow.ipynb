    "This web app is the outcome of being a full time Data Scientist and a hardcore UFC fan. As a hardcore UFC fan, it has always been a challenge to predict the winner of a fight. It is either the **Favourite** or **Underdog**. However, there are times where my predictions go horribly wrong. Being the curious person I am, I found myself asking questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How often do favourites triumph over underdogs?\n",
    "* Do fighters with better fighting stats always win?\n",
    "* What are the most important skills that determines the winner? Is it striking? Wrestling? BJJ?\n",
    "* How has the MMA sport evolved? Do fights go the distance more?\n",
    "\n",
    "All these questions then lead me to build a web app that utilizes machine learning to predict the winner of a fight. This app will then contribute as a validation point to my predictions. "

    "* Predicts better than choosing all favourite only (roughly 60%)\n",
