# UFC MMA Predictor

The UFC MMA Predictor **embed link here** is a web app to predict fights exclusively in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). Please use at your own discretion as there is no guarentee of profit. This is also considered a professional project of mine.

Here you will find the following documents:

* Jupyter Notebook of data science pipeline for the project
* Python scripts to the web app
* R web scraping scripts 
* Demo of the app

# Getting Started

Here are a few information you need to have before using the web app:

* Fight card information (who is fighting who)
* Fighter information (weightclass and name)
* Betting odds (preferred decimal odds), knowing who is the favourite and underdog fighter beforehand

## Things to note

Here are some of the trends that have been spotted in recent MMA years to note:

* Picking favourite only gives 60% chance of winning in long term
* Fights go on longer in general 
* Southpaws win 53% of their fights, as opposed to 48% for orthodox fighters 
* Fighters who switch stances have an even higher success rate than both orthodox and southpaw fighters, with a combined win percentage of 57%

# Demo
